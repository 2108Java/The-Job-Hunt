Project Name: The Job Hunt
Team Name: The PoJo's
Project goal(s)/problem statement:
Using USAJobs API, (stretch goal)Census API
	The Project will allow applicants to easily search for jobs and apply or save them for later. This will allow for a
simpler process for applicants to find jobs based on different fields like location, title, keywords, or the type of
sechdule the job is. This is different from other such sites as it will be primarily for government jobs rather
than normal public jobs. Applicants will be able to register for an account and be given a temporary password to 
initialize an account and keep track of all saved and applied for jobs.
